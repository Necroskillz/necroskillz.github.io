After experiences gained during my last and current project, I made a
lot of changes and improvements to NecroNetToolkit, and also a few new
features. I’m not done quite yet, but I wanted to put the new version
out there, since the stuff that’s left to do is mostly unit tests and
documentation.

I will be rewriting most of the wiki pages and writing new unit tests
when I get the chance. As far as new functionality is concerned, the
most I will do for this version is add some general extension methods.
However I have some plans to add some new features after the conclusion
of the development of my current project.

A bit of warning though: **this release is NOT backwards compatible and
contains a lot of BREAKING CHNAGES to the API**.
